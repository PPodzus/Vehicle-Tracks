A rigged vehicle track system, all linked to a single mother object to make moving it around easier.
The rig is not ready for scaling yet (wheel rotation speed needs fixing)
Polycount: 51k
Total 100 track pieces
Availble rigged for 3DS Max 2012, 2014 and as an animated object in .FBX
The .avi file contains a simple render showing a single loop of the tracks.

ToDo:
